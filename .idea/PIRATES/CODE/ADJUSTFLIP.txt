🚨 Recommendation for Scalping (1–5 Min)

If you’re trying to actually use this for entry/exit on lower TFs, you may want to tune for responsiveness:

⚙️ Suggested "Faster" Settings:
Setting	Conservative Scalper	Aggressive Scalper
Supertrend Factor	4–6	2–3
Supertrend ATR Period	20–30	10–14
WMA Length	21	10
EMA Length	9	5–7
SL ATR Multiplier	2–3	1.5–2
TP Multipliers	1 / 2 / 3	1.5 / 2.5 / 4

These values will catch moves faster, but increase the risk of false signals. You can reduce that by layering in volume filters, price action confirmation, or volatility contraction logic.
