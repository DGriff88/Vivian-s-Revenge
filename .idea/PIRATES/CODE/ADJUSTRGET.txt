Do you want more signals (more noise too)? ➜ Decrease ATR Period, Supertrend Factor.

Want tighter stops? ➜ Lower SL ATR Multiplier to maybe 2–3.

Want risk/reward better than 1:1? ➜ Raise TP multipliers or lower SL.



For scaling TP logic: consider testing 0.75 / 1.25 / 2.0 to see if you get better long-tail trades.
