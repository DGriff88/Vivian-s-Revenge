Turning $100 into $1,000


Achieve a 10x return in under 30 days; realistic with the right strategies and rules.


This presentation reveals strategies used to turn $100 into over $1,000 in 30 days.


Key Rules Before Strategies

Rules Are Essential

These rules are crucial; strategies won’t work without them; these rules were followed to achieve 10x growth.


Rule #1: High Risk-to-Reward Ratio

Minimum 1:3 Risk-to-Reward

Defining Risk-to-Reward

Profit potential must be at least three times the risk; for example, risking $20 should yield a potential $60 profit.

Importance of High Reward

Taking average trades won’t cut it; each trade needs high profit potential.

Example of Unacceptable Trade

Low Potential Trade

A one:1 risk-to-reward setup is insufficient; risking $20 for a potential $20 profit is inadequate.


Rule #2: Use a Large Position Size

Aggressive Risk-Taking

Necessity for Small Accounts

To grow a small account quickly, be aggressive and take calculated risks; this method is specifically for smaller accounts.


My $100 Account Strategy

Risked 20% of balance per trade for every trade; a stop-loss hit results in a 20% loss (e.g., $20).

Managing the High Risk

Covering Losses

One winning trade can cover three losses due to the 1:3 risk-to-reward; making aggressive moves on a small account enables big wins.


Rule #3: Compounding Your Winners


The Power of Compounding

Accelerating Account Growth

This rule made the account grow faster than expected; continuous compounding wins on subsequent trades.

Example of Compounding

Start with $100, make $60 profit (balance is $160); instead of securing this profit, risk 20% of the new $160 balance on the next trade.

The Impact of Compounding Wins

Potential Profits

Risking 20% of $160 ($32) could yield a $96 profit with 1:3 risk-to-reward; each winning trade is added to the next trade, and the impact is exponential…

Rule #4: Medium Time Frames Only

Choosing the Right Time Frame


The 15-Minute to 4-Hour Chart

Trade on medium time frames (15-minute to 4-hour chart); avoid higher time frames like daily charts, where each candle takes too long to form.

Avoiding Volatility

Avoid very low time frames (e.g., 1-minute chart); these are too volatile, and the strategies won’t work well.

Sweet Spot for Trading

Combining Speed and Reliability

The 15-minute to 4-hour time frame represents the spot; allowing for rapid compounding while remaining stable.

Strategy #1: Trend Pullback

Capitalizing on Trends Overview

Riding the Pullback Wave

Instead of chasing trends, enter during pullbacks for better risk-to-reward; if you ride a trend during a pullback, you’ll see more profits.

Key Steps

Identify trend direction, find fair value gaps, and wait for pullback.

Step 1: Identifying the Trend

Using the 50 EMA

Use an indicator like the 50 EMA (Exponential Moving Average) direction and price position relative to the EMA; uptrend if price is above, downtrend if below.

Determining the Trend

If the EMA slopes upwards and price is above it, it’s an uptrend; wait for a pullback downwards to enter a long position.

Step 2: Finding Fair Value Gaps

What is a Fair Value Gap?

The high of the first candle and the low of the third candle don’t overlap with the middle candle’s body; this creates a visible area called a fair value gap.

The Magnet Effect

Price typically pulls back into the gap and retests it, then bounces off continuing the original trend; enter your position on this pullback.

Implementing the Strategy: Example 1

Identifying Downtrend Shift

Price crosses above the 50 EMA, signaling a shift uptrend; wait for pullback to buy into this uptrend.

Spotting the Gap

Look for a large green candle where the high of the previous candle doesn’t overlap the low of the next; gap must be large and valid for entry.

Executing the Trade

Wait for price to pull back into the gap, confirm the uptrend structure, and wait to enter with stop-loss below the gap and take-profit at 3x the risk.

Implementing the Strategy: Example 2

Identifying Initial Downtrend

The 50 EMA slopes downwards and the price stays below it, indicating a clear downtrend.

Identifying Setup

Wait for a pullback upwards to enter a short position; look for confluence plus bearish gap.

Profitable Trading Process


Place a short position with a stop-loss slightly above the fair value gap; aim for a profit three times the risk.

Strategy #2: Trend Reversal


Timing Trend Reversals

Spotting the Exact Moment

Spot the exact moment a downtrend is about to end and time your buy entry right before the trend reverses.

Using Volume

Use volume to time reversals with high accuracy; volume measures the strength behind a price movement; for example, uptrend with high volume signifies strong momentum.

The Role of Volume


Interpreting Decreasing Volume

Decreasing volume indicates the trend is weakening, signaling a potential reversal.

Applying Volume Oscillator

Spotting key levels to validate a strong entry.

Implementing the Strategy: Example 1

Identifying Volume Spike

Volume indicator crosses above the 30% line, indicating a spike in volume.


Confirmations


Wait for price to start forming a reversal while the volume crosses back above the middle line; high volume should back new trend.


Executing the Trade


Place stop-loss just below entry with enough room; set take-profit at three times your risk.

Implementing the Strategy: Example 2


Initial Conditions

Identify a volume spike crossing above the 30% level; identify trend that led to spike…


Trend Reversal


Confirm the downtrend is losing strength, and wait for price to form reversal while volume crosses back; secure the profits.


Strategy #3: Trend Lines


The Power of Trend Lines

Trend Line Basics

A trend line is a simple line that connects multiple swing points in price.


Breakout Opportunities


If price breaks out of a trend line, it will move sharply; this presents a great trade opportunity if timed correctly.

Drawing Valid Trend Lines

Minimum Three Swing Points

Find at least three swing points in price to draw a valid trend line; connect them with a line; always check trend direction before drawing.

Placement Based on Trend

If market trending down, draw the trend line connecting swing high points; trending up, connect swing low points.


Implementing the Strategy


Wait for Significant Breakout

Wait for a significant breakout to avoid fake breakout traps
.
Entering on the Pullback

Enter on the pullback after the breakout for a better risk-to-reward; place a tight stop-loss just below the trend line and aim take profit at three times the stop loss.
