## EMA CONFIRMATION ENTRY STRATEGY
==================================================

### Purpose: 

Filter fakeouts/manipulation and nail high-probability entries

**1. Identify Market Trend With EMAs**
- 3 EMAs (9/21/50 or 9/21/160)
- Uptrend: fast > mid > slow
- Downtrend: fast < mid < slow
- ⚠️ Skip tangled/flat EMAs

**2. Pullback Into Dynamic EMA S/R**
- Wait for price to pull into EMA zone
- Check candles, wicks & volume
- ⚠️ Rejection wicks = possible fakeout

**3. Confirm With RSI**
- RSI(14) 40-60 = chop; avoid
- Long: RSI 40→70
- Short: RSI 60→30
- Bonus: RSI divergence

**4. Fakeout / Manipulation Filters**
Avoid when:
- Break closes back in range
- Lone news spike
- Volume dries up

**5. Confirm With Stochastic Oscillator**
- Use Stoch (14,3,3) or (5,5,3)
- ✓ %K under20→80 (bull)
- ✓ %K over80→20 (bear)
- Bonus: Stoch+RSI crossover

**6. Emotion Filter & Precision Entry**
Enter only when EMAs, RSI & Stoch agree
Triggers:
- Engulfing/hammer off EMA
- 5-min break of 15-min
- LTF break with HTF trend

==================================================
## ADVANCED EMA CONFIRMATION STRATEGY
==================================================

**1. Identify Market Trend with EMAs**
- Use 3 EMAs: 9/21/50 or 9/21/160 for longer TF
- Uptrend: If fast > mid > slow & EMAs ascending 
- Downtrend: If fast < mid < slow & EMAs descending
- Skip if EMAs are tangled/flat → higher manipulation risk

**2. Look for Pullback Into Dynamic EMA S/R**
- Wait for price to pull back into the zone between your EMAs
- Price should respect EMA levels as S/R
- Examine candle body size, wicks, and volume near EMAs
- Watch for rejection wicks = possible trap or fakeout

**3. Confirm with RSI**
- RSI(14) between 40-60 = chop; avoid unless confluence
- Long: RSI rising from 40-50 toward 60-70
- Short: RSI falling from 60-50 toward 40-30
- Bonus: RSI divergence with price strengthens the signal

**4. Fakeout / Manipulation Filters**
Avoid entries when:
- Hope candle breaks structure then closes back in range
- Liquidity sweep
- Price moves with no follow-through
- Volume dries up at the pullback zone

**5. Confirm with Stochastic Oscillator**
- Use Stoch (14,3,3) or (5,5,3) for faster reaction
- Bullish: %K crossing down over 80 and heads toward 20
- Bearish: %K crossing down over 80 and heads toward 20
- Bonus: Stoch + RSI crossover same direction = extra confluence

**6. Emotion Filter & Precision Entry**
So Far = only when all your EMAs, RSI and agree
All indicators confirm
Stochastics confirm

Entry trigger ideas:
- Bullish engulfing / hammer off EMA zone
- 5-min breakout of 15-min candle H/L
- LTF break of structure with HTF trend

**Days 21-30: Building Confidence and Practicing with Demo Trading**

1. Continue Demo Trading:
   - Maintain your demo trading and stick strictly to your plan
   - Begin tracking performance metrics: Identify winning setups and refine them
   - Aim for consistent execution, not quick profits

2. Develop a Trade Entry Checklist:
   - Create a checklist for entering trades

   - Reduce criteria to make sure you can quickly evaluate a setup without overcomplicating

3. Refine Your Strategy:
   - After completing 20-30 demo trades, analyze your performance

   - Start recording your emotions to deepen understanding of how they affect trading
   - Create habits that improve mental resilience: breaks, meditation, reflection after losses

**Days 51-60: Transitioning to More Realistic Trading**
1. Start Scaling Appropriately on Demo Account:

   - Treat demo trading like real trading so transition is similar as possible

2. Evaluate Your Progress:
   - Review journal regularly to evaluate which setups have been successful
   - Focus on long-term consistency and refining strategy, not trying to make big profits
   - If consistent for 20-30 trades or 2-3 months, ready for real money trading

### PHASE 3: Days 61-90 – The Mastery Phase
**Focus: Real Money Trading, Scaling, and Fine-Tuning Strategy**

**Days 61-70: Transition to Live Trading (Start Small)**
1. Start Trading with Real Money:

2. Fine-Tuning Your Strategy:
   - By this time, strategy should be solid
   - Continue to adjust based on ongoing trade analysis and feedback from journal
   - Stay consistent and refine rules, don't overhaul everything after a few losses

3. Focus on Consistency, Not Perfection:
   - Goal should be consistency over perfection
   - Aim for small but steady gains that compound over time
   - Avoid pressure to "make it big" quickly

### ONGOING FOCUS BEYOND 90 DAYS:

## THE FOUNDER'S PLAYBOOK MARKET RESEARCH FRAMEWORK
==================================================
*Note: This framework can be adapted for finding profitable trading opportunities and market trends*

### Core Philosophy
"You don't need to be an amazing leader, you just need to find an amazing market." - Don Valentine, Sequoia Capital

The key is exploiting large, early, desperate markets rather than trying to create them.

### STEP 1: Find Large, Desperate, Early Markets (Days 1-15)

**Idea Hack #1: Consulting Jacking**
Leverage research from consulting firms who release free white papers:
- McKinsey: https://www.mckinsey.com/featured-insights
- BCG: https://www.bcg.com/publications  
- Bain: https://www.bain.com/insights/
- Deloitte: https://www2.deloitte.com/us/en/insights.html
- PwC: https://www.pwc.com/us/en/library.html
- KPMG: https://kpmg.com/us/en/insights-and-resources.html
- EY: https://www.ey.com/en_us/insights
- Accenture: https://www.accenture.com/us-en/insights-index

**Idea Hack #2: VC Trend Jacking**
Look at recent funding rounds to identify market trends:
- Crunchbase: https://www.crunchbase.com/
- YC Database: https://www.ycombinator.com/companies

**Market Evaluation Criteria:**

**Criteria #1: Large**
- Bottoms Up TAM Formula: # of potential customers × expected cost of product = TAM
- High-growth business: TAM should be > $1B
- VC funding: At least $2B TAM

**Criteria #2: Early** 
- Key Question: "Is the market experiencing disruption that is causing a problem that will only increase in future years?"

**Criteria #3: Desperate**
Three tests for desperate markets:
1. Are existing solutions addressing this early and growing problem? (If no, why not?)
2. Are existing workarounds good enough? (If yes, market isn't desperate)  
3. What's your market losing by not having a solution? (Must have large real or perceived loss)

### STEP 2: Validate Market Opportunities (Days 15-30)
- Live conversations with real humans (50 conversations recommended)
- Customer discovery process: understand problems, pain points, priority, and potential solutions
- Use open-ended questions, avoid leading questions
- Goal: 5 conversations per day for 10 days

### STEP 3: Build a CAB - Customer Advisory Board (Days 45-60)  
- Create clickable prototypes using AI tools, Figma, etc.
- Circle back to validated prospects from Step 2
- CAB Pitch Script: Position as "innovative industry leaders" helping guide product development
- Offer 70% lifetime discount for CAB members
- Goal: Minimum 5 CAB members, preferably 10

### STEP 4: Launch a Black Car Product (Days 60-90+)
- Build narrowly scoped product that solves one problem only
- "Any customer can have a car painted any color that he wants, so long as it is black." - Henry Ford
- Focus on shipping and earning customers, not impressive features
- Don't build additional features until you've sold the core product repeatedly
