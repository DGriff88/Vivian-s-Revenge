2. Asset Selection: Target highly volatile assets (e.g., currency pairs, indices) to capitalize on swift price movements.
3. Chart Setup: Use one-minute candlestick charts for detailed price tracking.
4. Technical Indicators: Apply fast-responding indicators like Exponential Moving Averages (EMA) and Relative Strength Index (RSI) to detect momentum and reversal signals.
5. Entry Strategy: Define precise, rule-based entry points (e.g., enter trades when price crosses EMA with RSI confirming momentum direction).
6. Risk Management: Implement strict trade sizing and set maximum permissible loss per trade to safeguard capital.
7. Consistent Review: Regularly evaluate trading performance and refine strategy based on results.
