Detect specific chart patterns from 1-minute candlestick charts and generate buy signals based on these patterns. Specifically, identify patterns such as double bottom and head and shoulders. For each detected buy signal, provide detailed points and conditions that need to be confirmed before taking action.

Follow these steps:

1. Analyze the 1-minute candlestick chart data to identify occurrences of classic reversal patterns including but not limited to double bottom and head and shoulders.
2. When a pattern is detected, verify relevant confirmation conditions such as volume increase, neckline breakout, or RSI levels to validate the pattern's reliability.
3. Upon confirming all the necessary conditions, generate a clear buy signal specifying the detected pattern.
4. Clearly describe the confirmation points or criteria used to issue the buy signal for transparency and verification.

Output the result in a structured format including:
- Pattern name detected
- Time or chart segment where detected
- Confirmation criteria met
- Buy signal indication

Use clear, concise language suitable for a technical trading audience.
