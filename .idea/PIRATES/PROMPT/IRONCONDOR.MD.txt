0DTE IRON CONDOR FOR OPEN (LIVE TRADING CHECKLIST)
Trade Thesis
OPEN is high IV, high beta, post-momentum, likely to chop in a tight range today.
Condor = optimal theta capture, defined risk, max profit if price stays in range.
Trade Construction
Sell 1x $5.75 Put (collect premium)
Buy 1x $5.50 Put (hedge downside)
Sell 1x $6.50 Call (collect premium)
Buy 1x $6.75 Call (hedge upside)
All legs expiring today (0DTE)!
Net Credit Target: $0.25–$0.50 per spread (you want to collect as much premium as possible, but adjust if fills are tough)
Max Loss: $0.25 (width minus net credit)
Max Gain: $0.50 (if all options expire OTM, stays $5.75–$6.50)
Entry Criteria
Only enter if IV is still high (IV Rank > 30%)
Enter after 10:00am ET, once opening whipsaws die down
Price should NOT be breaking above $6.50 or below $5.75
Position size based on max risk ($0.25/contract, so 10 spreads = $250 risk)
Position Management
Monitor every 30min
Set stop if price breaks $5.75 or $6.50 intraday
Profit Target: Close at 50% max profit if theta crushes fast (i.e., buy back for $0.25)
Hard Exit: Close all by 3pm ET

Execution Checklist
[x] Check liquidity on all strikes before entry
[x] Place limit order for max credit, work order if needed
[x] Set profit and loss alerts
[x] Document reasoning
If You Want an Aggressive Play:
Sell a straddle ($6 put & $6 call), but BEWARE: Unlimited risk.
Or, do a tight call spread or put spread if you get a directional read.
Tips:
NEVER hold 0DTE options past 3:30pm ET (gamma risk/pin risk goes nuts last 30 mins).
Don’t leg in or out unless you’re experienced—fill risk is real.
