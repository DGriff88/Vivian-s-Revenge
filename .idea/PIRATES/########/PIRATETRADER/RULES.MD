# PIRATETRADER — One‑Page Paycheck Blueprint (Locked)

**Anchor:** Fresh restart: **Sep 21, 2025 — 8:44 p.m. PT**

---

## Mission (one line)
Generate consistent weekly income ($300–$500 baseline) using defined‑risk option debit spreads + IRA wheel income while protecting capital.

---

## Core Rules (non‑negotiable)
- One spread per ticker. No stray legs. Cancel all GTC nightly.
- Per‑trade defined risk: **$40–$80 debit** (max per spread). R:R target ≥ 1:2 (prefer 1:3).
- Walk rule: stop trading for the day after **+$200** or **−$100** or **3 consecutive losses**.
- Work windows: **06:30–07:30 PT** and **12:00–13:00 PT** (max 2 trades per window).
- Never scalp IRA. Never sell CWH. NVDA/SOFI = backup funds only. SOFI floor $20+.

---

## Weekly Rhythm (operational)
- **Sunday night**: Whisper scan → shortlist 3–5 candidates (catalyst ≤8h, RVOL≥1.5).
- **Mon–Tue**: Enter 1–2 A+ spreads (3–7 DTE recommended). These are the paycheck seeds.
- **Wed–Thu**: Manage — partials, roll, or let ride if VWAP/EMA holds.
- **Fri**: Close weeklies, collect paycheck, nightly reset.

## Four Gates — Trade Checklist (must pass ≥3/4; fail any hard filters)
1. **Catalyst & Freshness**: PR, EDGAR/FDA/analyst/UOA within ≤4–8h.
2. **Alignment**: EMA 9/21/50 slope in trade direction; price near 21 EMA/VWAP.
3. **Momentum**: 2 of 3 confirm: RSI, Stochastic, MACD.
4. **Profit Math (options)**: OI ≥1,000 per strike; bid/ask ≤ $0.20; debit ≤ $80; R:R ≥1:2.

Hard rejects: stale catalyst (>8h), AH pop >+10% w/o pullback, tangled EMAs, weak volume.

  "confidence": 1-5,
  "why_now": "one-line catalyst & reason"
}
```

## Monday Reset Plan (step‑by‑step — first 60 minutes)
1. **Account hygiene** — cancel GTCs, list open orders, close stray legs. Do NOT open new spreads until cleaned.
2. **Half‑Stack** — split available cash: **live stack** (~half) for trades, remainder is buffer.
3. **Top candidates** — run scanner shortlist; mark 2 primary payoff candidates, 1 backup.
4. **Execute** — place **one** spread (debit ≤$80) in first hour if all Four Gates pass. Use GFD (day) only.
5. **Manage rules** — move stop to breakeven after +1R; take partials at +$20–50; runner for $50–100+.

## Risk & Position Sizing (daily operational)
- Per trade risk cap = **$80**. Prefer $40–$60 early while rebuilding edge.
- Daily max loss target = −$150 (hard guard). Walk at −$100 or after 3 reds.
- Position sizing: 1 contract for small accounts; scale only after consistent wins.

---

## Nightly Reset Checklist
- Log trades, P/L, lessons learned.
- Run Whisper scan (SEC/FDA/DOJ, after‑hours PR, pre‑market RVOL ≥2.0, unusual options sweeps).
- Update Monday shortlist file and mark zones (prior day high/low, pre‑mkt hi/lo, VWAP, EMA levels).
- Cancel GTCs.
- Scanner Params 
- Universe: Price $10–$150, AvgVol ≥2M, MarketCap ≥$1B.
- Options: OI ≥1k, B/A ≤$0.20.
- Freshness: catalyst ≤8h; RVOL ≥1.5; AH pop ≤+10% with pullback rule.
- Signals: UOA sweeps, SEC EDGAR filings, FDA/analyst/activist news, large block trades.

---

## Emergency Rules (if things go sideways)
- If account drawdown >20% of total equity: stop trading for 7 days; review strategy.
- If more than 3 consecutive losing weeks: haircut trade size by 50% until regain.

Pin this page. Use it every morning. Repeat the process for 30 trading days — optimize only after consistent results.
